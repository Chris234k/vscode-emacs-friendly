# vscode-emacs-friendly
This repo is a fork of a fork. Original repo: was created by [hiro-sun](https://github.com/hiro-sun/vscode-emacs). Seems like it has been a while since the original dev worked on it. Development continued in the fork by [SebastianZaha](https://github.com/SebastianZaha/vscode-emacs-friendly).

Changes in this repo will largely be in my personal taste, rather than in the interest of preserving emacs functionality.
